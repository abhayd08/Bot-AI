# Bot-AI

This project aims to create an interactive chatbot application where users can engage in conversations with an AI model and provide feedback at each stage of the conversation. The chatbot utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user inputs effectively.

#

## Reasoning Behind Technical Choices

### Vite

- I chose Vite as the build tool for this project due to its fast development server and quick startup time. It's well-suited for modern web development workflows and provides efficient bundling and hot module replacement.

### Gemini API

- I integrated the Gemini API to power the chatbot's AI capabilities. Gemini provides state-of-the-art natural language processing models that generate human-like responses to user queries, enhancing the user experience of the application.

#

## Reasoning Behind Design Choices

### Figma Design with Custom Touches

- I opted for the Figma design as the foundation for the web app's UI. I customized the design with unique touches to align it with the project's branding and theme. This ensures a visually appealing and cohesive user interface.

### Theme

- I've implemented both light and dark themes in the application to ensure a consistent look and feel across all components. This approach enhances readability, usability, and the overall user experience. Users have the flexibility to switch between themes at any time.
